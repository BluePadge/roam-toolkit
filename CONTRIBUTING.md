## Intro

**Roam Toolkit** is written using [WebExtensions API](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/about-the-webextensions-api/) to ensure that it can run on both Chrome and Firefox.  
It's written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - a superset of JavaScript that introduces support 
for static typing.

### Prerequisites

1. You need to set up `NodeJS` and `npm` on your machine to be able to build the extension. 
Follow this guide to set them up: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/

1. (__**Optional**__) As mentioned above the plugin is written in TypeScript - so going through short 
introduction to the language, if you're not familiar with it yet, will prove useful.   
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html is a short official introduction. 
And there is a lot of material out there if you want to learn more!

1. Get a good editor ðŸ˜‰. My favorite is [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is pretty good too.

1. If you haven't worked with GitHub before - look at this guide https://www.thinkful.com/learn/github-pull-request-tutorial/#Time-to-Submit-Your-First-PR to figure out the general contribution process. 


## Running the plugin in development mode

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and then clone your fork locally. 

    `git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/roam-toolkit.git`
  
1. Install dependencies by running  
  `npm install`

1. Build the plugin. Here you have two options:
    * `npm run dev` - run one time build
    * `npm run watch` - (**recommended**) continuously watch for changes in your source code 
    and rebuild the plugin & reload it in the browser.  
    This mode is great for continuous iteration as it introduces a minimal 
  friction between making a change and seeing the result. It'll even reload the browser page for you 
  where the plugin is loaded, to ensure that your changes are applied.
  
1. Load extension into the browser
   
   **Chrome**
   
   1. Go to: [**chrome://extensions**](chrome://extensions)
   1. Toggle: "**developer mode**" on.
   1. Click on: "**Load unpacked**"
   1. Select the newly created folder "**dist**" from the project folder.
   1. That's it.
   
   **Firefox**
   1. Go to: [**about:debugging**](about:debugging)
   1. Select: "**Enable add-on debugging**"
   1. Click on: "**Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦**"
   1. Open the newly created folder "**dist**" from the project folder, and choose the "**manifest.json**" file.
   1. That's it.
 
## Example feature with settings

Let's take a look at a simple example feature to understand on how you can go about adding a new one
in such a way that it'd integrate with the settings menu.  
The example feature would be a shortcut to **copy block reference** of the block. 

To implement this feature we'll need to do the following things:  
1. Create a file in [features](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/tree/master/src/ts/core/features)
directory that contains feature description and implementation. Here is an example: 

    ```typescript
    import {Feature, Shortcut} from '../settings'
   
    export const config: Feature = { // An object that describes new feature we introduce
        id: 'block_manipulation',  // Feature id - any unique string would do
        name: 'Block manipulation',  // Feature name - would be displayed in the settings menu
        settings: [ // List of settings for the feature
            {
                type: 'shortcut', // Type of the setting. See other ones defined here: https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/blob/master/src/ts/core/settings/settings.ts#L36 
                id: 'copyBlockRef', // Id of the setting - any unique string would do
                label: 'Copy Block Reference',  // Shortcut name - would be displayed in setting menu
                initValue: 'ctrl+shift+c',  // Initial shortcut value
                // This defines what function would be called when shortcut is pressed 
                onPress: () => navigator.clipboard.writeText(getCurrentBlockReference()), 
            } as Shortcut,
        ],
    }

    function getCurrentBlockReference () {
      // code that retrieves current block reference
    }
    ```
   
   The original code for this feature can be found at https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/blob/master/src/ts/core/features/block-manipulation.ts#L5

1. Add the newly defined feature to the list of all features to be loaded [here](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/blob/master/src/ts/core/features/index.ts#L12).  

    For our block manipulation feature it'd look like:
    ```typescript
    // Import the feature we've created
    import {config as blockManipulation} from './block-manipulation'

    //...
    // Add it to the list of all features
       all: prepareSettings([
           //...   
           blockManipulation,
       ]), 
    ``` 
   
1. You should have your new shiny feature working now ðŸŽ‰

### Bare minimum example (without settings):

1. Create a TypeScript file anywhere in [core directory](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/tree/master/src/ts/core) - for the example purposes we'll assume that you've created 
`src/ts/core/features/hello_world.ts` with the following content:

    ```typescript
    alert("Hello World!")
    ```
1. Import your file from [src/ts/contentScripts/entry/index.ts](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/blob/master/src/ts/contentScripts/entry/index.ts) by adding the following line to it: 

   `import '../../core/features/hello_world'`
   
   This is required to ensure it's loaded with the extension. 
   
1. You should have your new shiny hello world now ðŸŽ‰

## Code structure
* [Main source dir](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/tree/master/src/ts)
* [Tests](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/tree/master/tests/ts)

### Entry point

[src/ts/contentScripts/entry/index.ts](src/ts/contentScripts/entry/index.ts) Is the entry-point file for the extension. For code to be
 loaded/executed - it has to be directly or transitively be imported from this file. 

### Features directory 

[/src/ts/core/features/](src/ts/core/features/) 
directory contains entry points for most of the features in the Toolkit. If you're developing a new 
Feature - you should put entry point for it here.   
`index.ts` file within that directory defines the [list of all features](https://github.com/roam-unofficial/roam-toolkit/blob/master/src/ts/core/features/index.ts#L13). It can also serve as a good starting point 
 for exploring the code if you are curious for how any particular feature works.  

### Roam interaction interfaces and utils

Toolkit provides a variety of utilities and abstractions to make it easier for you to interact with 
various aspects of Roam.   
[src/ts/core/roam](src/ts/core/roam) is a good entry point to start exploring these.

* [src/ts/core/roam/roam.ts](src/ts/core/roam/roam.ts) Provides abstraction for operating on Roam Blocks. Exposing operations like: 
  * Read/Write current block
  * Select current block
  * Delete block
  * Create blocks above/below/etc
  * And many more

* [src/ts/core/roam/roam-db.ts](src/ts/core/roam/roam-db.ts) - An interface for querying Roam database directly, exposing some pre-prepared queries and the ability to submit raw [Datalog](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) queries 
* [src/ts/core/roam/date/index.ts](src/ts/core/roam/date/index.ts) - Interacting with Roam Date (parsing, formatting, etc)

* [src/ts/core/roam/navigation.ts](src/ts/core/roam/navigation.ts) - Interface for navigating to different Roam
pages in the browser (by name, date, etc) .

* Simulating [keyboard](src/ts/core/common/keyboard.ts) and [mouse](src/ts/core/common/mouse.ts) events
 

## Unit testing

Unit tests in Roam Toolkit use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) framework. 
Adding tests for you features is strongly encouraged.
